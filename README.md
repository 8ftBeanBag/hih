Welcome to Help is Here! (We say hih pronounced "hi") Thanks for being one of our awesome contributors.

## OS
Please consider using a unix based system since our linting tends to perform best there. 

## Install
If you've developed with node before, this should be just like riding a bike for you!
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the app
Make sure to copy the .env.local.template and update the variables in there so you have connections to the APIs used.
```bash
npm run dev
```
And just like that, you should be set!
